## Background

I am **Moxin Tang (唐墨馨)**, an undergraduate student majoring in **Industrial Engineering** at Nanjing University with a minor in **Computer Science**. I am currently a visiting student at the **University of California, Berkeley** (Aug 2025 - Dec 2025), where I'm taking advanced courses in algorithms, deep learning, and machine learning.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on the intersection of **optimization** and **machine learning**, particularly:

- **Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)** and combinatorial optimization
- **Graph Neural Networks** for optimization problems
- **Stochastic and dynamic optimization** modeling
- Applications in **transportation systems** and **scheduling problems**

## Current Work

I am currently working at the Operations Research Lab at Nanjing University, where I'm investigating how **Graph Neural Networks** can be used to detect disjunctive structures in MILP during preprocessing. This work aims to strengthen LP relaxations and improve branching heuristics in modern MILP solvers.

## Competition Experience

I actively participate in mathematical modeling and algorithm competitions:

- **Third Prize** at CTS Algorithm Competition (2025) - Airline crew scheduling
- **Second Prize** at Mathor Cup Mathematical Modeling Competition (2025) - Vehicle routing optimization
- **Second Prize** at Huawei Software Elite Challenge (2025) - AI systems optimization

## Academic Achievement

I am ranked in the **top 20%** of my major and have been awarded the People's Scholarship at Nanjing University.
