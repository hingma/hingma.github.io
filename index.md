**Moxin Tang（唐墨馨）**

I am an undergraduate student in **Industrial Engineering** at Nanjing University, currently visiting the **University of California, Berkeley**.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **optimization, operations research, and machine learning**, with a particular focus on:

- **Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)** and computational optimization
- **Graph Neural Networks** for combinatorial optimization
- **Stochastic and dynamic optimization** modeling
- Applications in **transportation systems** and **algorithm design**

I have experience in mathematical modeling competitions and algorithm challenges, where I've developed solutions for real-world optimization problems including airline crew scheduling, dynamic pricing, and vehicle routing.
